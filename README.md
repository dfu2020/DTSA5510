## Project Summary
In this project, I will be using unsupervised learning and supervised learning techniques to classify cars from a given database.

I will be perform the following tasks:
 1. Perform data cleaning and derive a `price_category` categorical label from the car price information.
 2. Using unsupervised learning techniques, namely `K-Means` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and the `Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization), to predict the `price_category` labels.  
 3. Compare the classification of unsupervised learning with supervised learning techniques such as `Random Forest` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and `Logistic Regression` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression).

The goal of this project is to compare supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and understand the appropriateness of using them for categorical label clustering.
